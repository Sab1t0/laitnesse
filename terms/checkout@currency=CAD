                    EU law provides you with a right of withdrawal on software
                    sales (i.e. the agreement between you and Us). This
                    can be excluded for digitally provided content once the
                    content is provided to the end user. The EU statutory right
                    of withdrawal ends 14 days after you purchase or (where you
                    have provided the appropriate consent and acknowledgement)
